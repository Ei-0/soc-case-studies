# Potential Insider Data Access Investigation

## Environment
A technology organization with an internal IT team and multiple
departmental file shares. Several systems contain sensitive financial
and human resources data. IT administrators have broad access across
systems as part of their operational responsibilities.

User activity is logged centrally, including file access events and
device-level actions. No active alerts were triggered at the start of
this investigation.

## Initial Signal
The investigation began following an internal notification that
sensitive financial documents had appeared outside of their expected
storage location. No security alerts or automated detections had been
triggered at the time.

Due to the nature of the report, the investigation was approached from
a post-incident (DFIR) perspective, focusing on determining how the
data was accessed, by whom, and through which mechanism.
