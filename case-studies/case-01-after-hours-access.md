# After-Hours Access to Financial Data

## Environment
A medium-sized organization with approximately 300 employees.
The environment includes an internal file server hosting financial
documents. Business hours are from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM.
Non-IT users do not normally use PowerShell as part of their daily work.

## Initial Signal
The investigation began after a successful login was observed outside
of normal business hours. The login involved a finance department user
accessing the system at approximately 2:17 AM from an internal workstation.

At this stage, the activity was treated as an event rather than a
confirmed incident, as no malicious behavior had yet been observed.
